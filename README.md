# Caesar Cypher Decrypter - Pair Programing

## Pair Programing with Developer Charlie Actor (charlieactor)

Pair programing exercise with Charlie Actor at Skill Distillery.
This project uses thread based programming to go through the various possible solutions for the cypher instead of using a basic for loop. Thread based programming is better in certain scenarios but not all the time. This example did not need to be threaded, but is a good simple way to outline it.
